## README for front-end: Youth Baseball Batting Order Tracker:

As a member and volunteer of my youth Baseball league we need a better way of
creating batting orders for teams on a seasonal basis.  Right now we use
paper and often the batting order are generated by hand just before a game.
The goal of this project will be to provide an option for entering a batting order
and then provide a means of keeping the data saved.

A secondary goal of the project is to lay the ground work for creating a suite
of 'easy-to-use' tools for our league coaches.

## Third Party Integration: Chatwee
Chatwee is a third party who provides chat service at a low to no cost basis.
Integration with Chatwee may be as simple as including a script tag in each
page of the league website.  Chatwee provides basic chat features which also
include file transfer.  This site uses the simplist integration, but may in the
future use more advanced integration features.

## Resources
For v1 of this application there are three resources used;  Users, Players, Seasons.
PlayerSeason represents the join table which creates the association between the
players and seasons.

Users represent board members or coaches who will login to the application to enter data
associated with a season and player.  Player data is kept in a player table and contains
the following fields:

```
  Type      Field Name
+---------+---------------------
string        "first_name"
string        "last_name"
string        "team"
string        "program"
string        "notes"
string        "position"
string        "batting_position"
integer       "batting_avg"
datetime      "created_at"
datetime      "updated_at"
bigint        "user_id"
index         ["user_id"], name: "index_players_on_user_id"
```

Seasons are made up of a year, team, and program.  Players are assigned to a
single season each year.

```
  Type      Field Name
+---------+---------------------
string        "year"
string        "team"
string        "program"
datetime      "created_at"
datetime      "updated_at"
bigint        "user_id"
index         ["user_id"], name: "index_seasons_on_user_id"
```


# Resource APIs
User Resource Actions:
```
-HTTP Verb-+ ---- URL -----+---- Description ------------------+
    POST         /sign-up      creates a user
    POST         /sign-in      retrieves a list of all players
    DELETE       /players:id   logs the user out
    PATCH        /players:id   changes the user's password

User Resource Notes:
This full stack project uses the same General Assembly authentication api as was
used for the Tic Tac Toe Project. Sample parameters are provided in JSON format
below.
```

sign-in:
```
  "credentials": {
    "email": "'"${EMAIL}"'",
    "password": "'"${PASSWORD}"'",
    "password_confirmation": "'"${PASSWORD}"'"
  }
```
sign-up:
```
"credentials": {
  "email": "'"${EMAIL}"'",
  "password": "'"${PASSWORD}"'",
  "password_confirmation": "'"${PASSWORD}"'"
}
```
change-password
```
"passwords": {
  "old": "'"${OLDPW}"'",
  "new": "'"${NEWPW}"'"
}
```
sign-out or logout requires only the user ID and the authentication token
